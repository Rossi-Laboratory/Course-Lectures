# AI Course Assignments

This repository contains three major assignments designed to build fundamental understanding and practical skills in Artificial Intelligence. Each assignment introduces a different paradigm of AI problem-solving, ranging from classic search methods to modern learning-based techniques.

## Assignments Overview

1. **Greedy Best-First Search**  
   Implement and analyze a heuristic-based search strategy to efficiently explore problem spaces.  
   Focus: Search algorithms, heuristics, and performance evaluation.

2. **Genetic Algorithm**  
   Explore evolutionary computation by designing a genetic algorithm for optimization problems.  
   Focus: Population initialization, selection, crossover, mutation, and convergence analysis.

3. **Neural Networks**  
   Build and train neural networks to solve classification and regression tasks.  
   Focus: Backpropagation, activation functions, training dynamics, and evaluation metrics.
